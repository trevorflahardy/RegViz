= Abstract
RegViz is a from-scratch, Rust-based learning environment that makes the classic equivalence between regular expressions and finite automata tangible. The system tokenizes and parses user-provided expressions, builds Thompson NFAs, determinizes them into DFAs, and exposes every intermediate structure to the learner through richly annotated visuals. By placing formal language theory into an interactive feedback loop, the tool replaces static textbook diagrams with living artifacts that respond to every keystroke.

The project delivers two tightly coupled components. The `regviz_core` library implements a reusable compilation pipeline—lexer, Pratt parser, Thompson constructor, subset construction, Hopcroft minimization, and simulators—while the `regviz_app` frontend embeds those capabilities inside an Iced-powered desktop/WASM client. Together they provide a transparent, inspectable transformation of regex syntax into executable automata, complete with bounding boxes, zoomable canvases, simulation traces, and immediate validation of input strings.

Pedagogically, RegViz encourages exploration: students can compare AST structure with the resulting automata, toggle operator-specific overlays, and step through acceptance runs that highlight exactly which states and transitions are active. Educators gain a durable artifact that can be demoed in lecture, distributed as a native binary, or hosted via GitHub Pages without sacrificing insight into the underlying algorithms.
