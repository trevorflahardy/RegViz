= Conclusion
RegViz demonstrates that automata theory can be both rigorous and approachable when implementation and presentation move in lockstep. The `regviz_core` crate captures the full compilation story—lexing, parsing, Thompson construction, determinization, minimization, and simulation—in auditable Rust modules, while the `regviz_app` frontend turns those data structures into interactive canvases paired with immediate feedback. Because every UI affordance is backed by a concrete algorithm (`build_nfa_trace`, `min::minimize`, `GraphCanvas` layouts), students can trace a straight line from an operator they type to the exact states and transitions it generates.

By releasing the project as open-source workspace crates plus reproducible build pipelines, we invite instructors to adopt, extend, and critique the tool without opaque dependencies. Learners gain an exploratory sandbox where they can form hypotheses (“What if I add `?` here?”), watch the AST and automata respond in real time, and confirm their intuition by stepping through acceptance traces. Bridging symbolic regex processing with graphical intuition ultimately reduces cognitive distance: regular languages stop being static definitions and become artifacts one can inspect, manipulate, and understand.
